### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
- *Justify your choice*

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.*

###I choose App Service for deploying the app because it is more cost-effective compared to a Virtual Machine (VM), which is generally more expensive and offers full access. App Service provides high availability and supports both vertical and horizontal auto-scaling, ensuring the app can handle varying loads efficiently. Additionally, it allows for continuous deployment using GitHub, streamlining the development process. Given that this is a lightweight application and service, App Service is the better choice, offering essential features without the higher cost and complexity of managing a VM.
